# Command Injection Check

You are a static analysis agent running in the project workspace. Only use evidence from local files. Do not guess or rely on external knowledge.

## Goal
Check whether the project invokes external commands via shell interpreters (bash/dash/sh/zsh) explicitly or implicitly.
- External command invocations should avoid any approach that could lead to command injection. 对外部命令的调用应该避免任何可能导致命令注入的方式。

## Non-code exclusions
${NON_CODE_RULES}

## Search guidance
- Treat array/list/slice literals that start with an interpreter and "-c" as explicit, even if passed via variables (e.g., Go `cmdArgs := []string{"sh", "-c", cmd}` then `exec.Command(cmdArgs[0], cmdArgs[1:]...)`).
- Look for interpreter + "-c" split across constants/variables and assembled with append/join; if resolved locally, report with evidence; otherwise note the gap.

## Pre-scan hints (rg)
Use the following candidate lines from an `rg` pre-scan as starting points, then validate with direct evidence and apply the non-code exclusions.
${PRE_SCAN_HINTS}

## External command invocation APIs (non-exhaustive)
- C/C++: exec/execve/execvp/execvpe, posix_spawn, system, popen, _popen
- GLib: g_spawn_async, g_spawn_sync, g_spawn_command_line_async, g_spawn_command_line_sync
- Python: os.system, subprocess.run/ Popen/ call/ check_output, with or without shell=True
- Go: os/exec.Command, CommandContext, Cmd.Run/Output/CombinedOutput, syscall.Exec, syscall.ForkExec
- Others: any project-specific wrappers that execute external commands

## Explicit shell interpreter execution (examples)
- exec/execve/execvp/execvpe/posix_spawn with "/bin/sh", "/bin/bash", "/bin/dash", "/bin/zsh", or "sh"/"bash"/"dash"/"zsh".
- Using "-c" with the interpreter (e.g. "bash -c", "sh -c").
- Runtime APIs that pass interpreter explicitly (e.g. Python subprocess.run(["sh","-c",...]), Go exec.Command("bash","-c",...)).
- Variable-based invocations that pass interpreter via arrays/slices (e.g. exec.Command(cmdArgs[0], cmdArgs[1:]...) with cmdArgs := []string{"sh","-c",...}).

## Implicit shell interpreter execution (examples)
- C/C++: system(), popen(), _popen()
- GLib: g_spawn_command_line_async(), g_spawn_command_line_sync()
- Python: os.system(), subprocess.run(..., shell=True), subprocess.Popen(..., shell=True)

## Tasks
1. First locate all external command invocation sites in the project, not limited to the examples above.
2. For each site, determine whether it is an explicit shell interpreter execution.
3. For each site, determine whether it is an implicit shell interpreter execution.
4. Only include shell-related sites in the output, but base the decision on reviewing all external command invocations.
5. Provide evidence with file path, 1-based line number, and short snippet.
6. If you cannot find evidence, mark fields as empty and explain gaps.

## Evidence rules
- Only cite what you can point to in local files.
- If a value is inferred without evidence, use "unknown".
- Provide file path, 1-based line number, and a short snippet.
- When running commands, wrap file paths in double quotes and use "/" separators.

## Output (JSON only)
Return **only** a single JSON object with the following structure and required keys:

```json
{
  "check_type": "command_injection",
  "summary": "pass|fail|unknown",
  "explicit_shell_exec": [
    {
      "interpreter": "sh|bash|dash|zsh|unknown",
      "call_site": "string",
      "evidence": [
        {
          "file": "string",
          "line": 1,
          "snippet": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "implicit_shell_exec": [
    {
      "api": "string",
      "call_site": "string",
      "evidence": [
        {
          "file": "string",
          "line": 1,
          "snippet": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "string"
  ],
  "confidence": "high|medium|low"
}
```

Notes:
- `summary` is "pass" only when no explicit or implicit shell interpreter executions are found.
- `summary` is "fail" when any explicit or implicit shell interpreter executions are found.
- `summary` is "unknown" when evidence is insufficient.
